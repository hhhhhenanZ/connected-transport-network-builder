# Connected Transport Network Builder
![Connected Transport Network Diagram](/images/workflow.png)
This project builds a connected transportation network for DTALite traffic assignment tools by combining road network data (from OpenStreetMap) with Zone (Traffic Analysis Zone/ Census Tracts) data. The final outputs are GMNS-compatible files (`node.csv`, `link.csv`, etc.) that can be used for traffic simulation (e.g., in DTALite).

## üêç How to Configure the Environment

### Install Conda
If you don't have it already, install:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

Verify the installation:
```bash
conda --version
```

### Create a Conda Environment
Create a new environment named NetBuilder:
```bash
conda create -n NetBuilder python=3.11 numpy pandas matplotlib -y
conda activate NetBuilder
```

### Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install osm2gmns==1.0.1
pip install 'geopandas[all]'
```
Verify the installations:
```bash
python -c "import osm2gmns as og"
python -c "import geopandas as gpd; print('GeoPandas version:', gpd.__version__)"
```
### Verify the Setup
You can run the following quick test:
```bash
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import osm2gmns as og

print("GeoPandas version:", gpd.__version__)
print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
print("NumPy version:", np.__version__)
```

## üö¶ Usage Instructions:

This project involves three main processing steps to build a connected GMNS-compatible transport network 
from shapefiles and OpenStreetMap data.

---
### ‚úÖ Step 1: Extract Physical Network from OSM

**Script:** `Read_OSM_File.py`  
**Input:**  
- OSM `.osm` file (e.g., `data/Tempe.osm`)

**Output:** Physical network 
- `node.csv`  
- `link.csv`  

This step extracts the **physical road network** from an OSM map file and generates a base **GMNS-style network** with `node.csv` and `link.csv`.
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è For more information about OSM file formats, see the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_file_formats).

---
### ‚úÖ Step 2: Extract Zone Centroid Data
### üó∫Ô∏è Prepare Zone Geometry and Centroids

This step provides instructions to locate zone data and prepare the polygon geometry and centroid information. 
The output should include each zone‚Äôs **centroid coordinates** (longitude, latitude) and polygon geometry in **Well-Known Text (WKT)** format.


You can source zone (TAZ/Census Tracts) data from the following resources:

1. **Use Census Tracts as Zones**  
   Shapefiles for U.S. census tracts are available here:  
   üëâ [U.S. Census Bureau - Census Tracts Shapefiles (2021)](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2021&layergroup=Census+Tracts)

2. **City/County-specific GIS data**  
   Some cities and counties provide public access to tract shapefiles:
   - [Phoenix Census Tracts (2010)](https://koordinates.com/layer/96425-phoenix-arizona-census-tracts-2010/)
   - [Tempe Census Tracts (2020)](https://data.tempe.gov/datasets/f278c2c622c249b0a543d9cc31dba525_0/explore)

**Script:** `Read_Zone_Data.py`     
**Input:**
- Zone (TAZ/Census Tracts) shapefiles (e.g., `Census_Tract_Boundary.shp`, .dbf, .shx, .prj, etc.)

**Output:**      
- `zone_centroid.csv`
---
### ‚úÖ Step 3: Generate Connected Network
### üß© Connect Zone Centroids with the Physical Network

To streamline GMNS network creation for tools like **TransCAD**, **Cube**, **VISUM**, **DTALite**, and **path4gmns**, 
this step connects **Zone centroids** to the physical network using:

- **Activity nodes** (red dots in the diagram)  
- **Connector links** (green lines)  
- **Artificial connectors** to physical nodes

This design follows the **Forward Star Structure**, where each **zone centroid** is a central hub connected to nearby network nodes, improving performance and compatibility for traffic assignment.

![Forward Star Structure](images/forward_star.png)

üîé **Simple way to identify activity nodes**:  
An **activity node** is any node in `node.csv` that has a non-null `zone_id` value.

üìò For detailed explanation of the Forward Star Network Structure, see the  
üëâ [TAPLite Wiki: Forward Star Structure ‚Äì Centroid Nodes and Connectors](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/TAPLite/wiki/Forward-Star-Network-Structure%3A-Centroid-Nodes-and-Connectors)

**Script:** `Connector_Generation.py`
**Input:**  
- `node.csv`  
- `link.csv`  
- `zone_centroid.csv`

**Output (`connected_network` folder):**
- `node_updated.csv` ‚Üí **Rename to** `node.csv` for DTALite compatibility
- `link_updated.csv` ‚Üí **Rename to** `link.csv` for DTALite compatibility

> ‚ö†Ô∏è These two files are critical outputs and must be renamed to `node.csv` and `link.csv` respectively in order to be used with the DTALite traffic assignment tool.

> ‚úÖ Finally, your connected network consisting of the final versions of `node.csv` and `link.csv`, is ready for DTALite-based traffic assignment.

## üìÑGMNS Format for DTALite

Before using your output files in DTALite, please review the required [GMNS file format specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/146Nt9y53mUibze1Z0nezgCwtkY_4Ycb1j-wp_S86wqs/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure full compatibility.

This includes required fields and formatting for:
- `node.csv`
- `link.csv`
- `demand.csv`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Files must strictly follow GMNS standards for successful DTALite traffic assignment.

## üåê Related Projects and Applications

### üîß [Shp2gmns](https://github.com/yuxl7/Shp2gmns)

> *Convert Shapefiles to GMNS Format*

[Shp2gmns](https://github.com/yuxl7/Shp2gmns) is a Python-based tool designed to convert road network shapefiles into GMNS (General Modeling Network Specification) format. It simplifies the preprocessing of geospatial road data for transportation modeling, making it ideal for researchers and practitioners working with GIS-based road datasets.

You can use **Shp2gmns** as a complementary tool to this 
repository when your input data is in shapefile format instead of OSM. The generated GMNS-format files (e.g., `node.csv`, `link.csv`) can then be enriched using **this tool** (`Connector_Generation.py`) to integrate with zone data and build connected networks for DTALite or other traffic assignment workflows.

### üó∫Ô∏è [GMNS Plus Dataset](https://github.com/HanZhengIntelliTransport/GMNS_Plus_Dataset)

> *Standardized Multimodal GMNS Network Collection*

The [GMNS Plus Dataset](https://github.com/HanZhengIntelliTransport/GMNS_Plus_Dataset) is a curated collection of GMNS-formatted transportation networks for various cities and regions (e.g., Phoenix, Bay Area, Berlin). It is designed to support reproducible, standardized research in transportation modeling.

üîó This repository contributes to the GMNS Plus Dataset by generating clean, connected network files through [`osm2gmns`](https://github.com/jiawlu/OSM2GMNS) processing, generating connector links between zones and the physical network, and formatting outputs for DTALite-based traffic assignment workflows.

Look for networks where this tool helped preprocess and enhance spatial linkage between zones and road infrastructure.

### üì¶ Save or Share the Environment
To save your environment to a file:
```bash
conda env export > environment.yml
```
To recreate it later or on another machine:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate transport-net-builder
```

### üìù Notes

- Ensure all shapefile components (`.shp`, `.shx`, `.dbf`, `.prj`) are inside the `data/` folder.
- For advanced GIS operations:

```bash
pip install gdal
```
- To use Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
conda install jupyter -y
